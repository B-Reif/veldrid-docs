# Veldrid 4.3.2

*June 13, 2018*

Veldrid version 4.3.2 is now available. This is a minor patch version correcting a couple of issues in Veldrid's dependencies.

* NativeLibraryLoader: Bumped dependency version to 1.0.9. This fixes an issue related to loading native libraries in a published application.

* ImGui.NET: Bumped dependency version to 4.0.5. This allows the native library to be deployed to any "Linux" platform, rather than just Ubuntu.
