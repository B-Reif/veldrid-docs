# Veldrid 4.6.0

_2019-03-27_

Veldrid 4.6.0 is now available for download. This is a small release with a few minor features, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.

Veldrid can be installed from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Veldrid/), and the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid).

## RenderDoc Support

A new library, Veldrid.RenderDoc, has been added to aid in debugging with [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/).

See [this post](https://mellinoe.dev/graphics/2019/01/23/renderdoc-integration-in-veldrid.html) for more information about the new feature and how to use it.

## Better SDL2 Input Handling

An extensible SDL2 event handling system has been added, and the existing SDL_Window-based events have been migrated on top of it. The Sdl2Events static class now acts as a registry for custom user callbacks, and can be used without any SDL2 window. This can be used to track gamepad events and state.

```C#
public static class Sdl2Events
{
    public static void Subscribe(SDLEventHandler processor);
    public static void Unsubscribe(SDLEventHandler processor);
    public static void ProcessEvents();
}
```

NeoDemo now contains basic gamepad controls, using a basic system built on top of the Sdl2Events class. See Sdl2ControllerTracker.cs in the NeoDemo project for more information.

## Internal Reference Counting for Vulkan Resources

Previously, the lifetime of resources in the Vulkan backen was more difficult to manage compared to others. Internally, the Vulkan backend now reference counts the resources that it allocates, and is able to ensure that resources stay alive until they are no longer referenced by anything, including in-progress CommandList submissions.

In practice, this means that you can now treat the lifetime of Vulkan resources the same as you would when using any other backend. It is safe to Dispose of a resource whose usage is still pending on the GPU, and Veldrid will wait to destroy it until it is safe to do so. Although there is a small amount of overhead to this internal tracking, it allows the Vulkan backend to behave identically to other backends.
