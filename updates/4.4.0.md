# Veldrid 4.4.0

*August 15, 2018*

Veldrid version 4.4.0 is now stable. On top of the changes in [4.4.0-beta2](4.4.0-beta2.md), there are a few extra fixes, and a couple of minor feature additions.

## Vertex Layout Offsets

Several complimentary features have been added to vertex and index buffers which allow you greater flexibility in specifying and storing vertex and index information.

* CommandList.SetVertexBuffer now has an overload accepting an offset in bytes. Vertex data will be read starting from that byte offset, rather than from the beginning of the buffer.
* CommandList.SetIndexBuffer also has a similar overload which accepts an offset in bytes.
* VertexElementDescription now contains an Offset field, which gives you greater control of the specific layout of information contained in a vertex buffer. If the Offset field has its default value of 0, then the elements are considered tightly-packed, as before. If any element in a vertex layout has an explicit offset specified, then all other elements must also have an explicit offset. Additionally, the offset values must be consistent with one another, be non-overlapping, etc.

## Additional Compressed Texture Formats

Veldrid now supports BC4, BC5, and BC7 compressed texture formats. Like other BC formats, these are not available on all systems, and support for them should be queried using GraphicsDevice.GetPixelFormatSupport before they are used.
