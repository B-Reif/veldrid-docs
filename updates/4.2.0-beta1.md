# Veldrid 4.2.0-beta1

Today, Veldrid 4.2.0-beta1 is available. This is a fairly large update with several exciting new features. Additionally, there are many bug fixes and performance improvements. Due to the volume of changes, I'm planning to gather some feedback with this beta version before marking it as stable.

## OpenGL ES Support

A fully-featured OpenGL ES backend has been added. This backend can be used on both Android and iOS, as well as on certain desktop platforms, provided the drivers and operating system support it. It is very similar to the existing OpenGL backend, and several changes and improvements have been made to the OpenGL backend as a result of this new support.

Veldrid requires at least __OpenGL ES version 3.0__. Some optional features, like compute shaders, require higher versions of OpenGL ES.

## Android Support

Veldrid now supports Android through the Vulkan and OpenGL ES backends. Vulkan remains a fairly advanced feature for current Android devices, but it will become more common in the future. OpenGL ES is supported by the majority of current Android devices.

A Veldrid GraphicsDevice can be created through an Android Surface or SurfaceView. Use the [SwapchainSource.CreateAndroidSurface()](xref:Veldrid.SwapchainSource#Veldrid_SwapchainSource_CreateAndroidSurface_IntPtr_IntPtr_) function to create a SwapchainSource for the given application view. Then, you can use [GraphicsDevice.CreateOpenGLES()](xref:Veldrid.GraphicsDevice#Veldrid_GraphicsDevice_CreateOpenGLES_Veldrid_GraphicsDeviceOptions_Veldrid_SwapchainDescription_) or [GraphicsDevice.CreateVulkan()](xref:Veldrid.GraphicsDevice#Veldrid_GraphicsDevice_CreateVulkan_Veldrid_GraphicsDeviceOptions_Veldrid_SwapchainDescription_), depending on what your device supports.

## GraphicsDevice Capabilities

Although Veldrid aims to be as portable as possible, there are a number of places where differences between different systems and API's cannot be cleanly hidden. Additionally, all graphics API's enforce specific limitations on how the API can be used. Without knowledge of these limitations at runtime, it's difficult to write code that is guaranteed to work portably. This version of Veldrid introduces several GraphicsDevice members informing you about the limitations of the current system.
* [GraphicsDeviceFeatures](xref:Veldrid.GraphicsDeviceFeatures) -- Enumerates the optional features supported by a GraphicsDevice.
* [bool GetPixelFormatSupport()](xref:Veldrid.GraphicsDevice#Veldrid_GraphicsDevice_GetPixelFormatSupport_Veldrid_PixelFormat_Veldrid_TextureType_Veldrid_TextureUsage_Veldrid_PixelFormatProperties__) -- Queries whether the current GraphicsDevice supports the given PixelFormat.
* [PixelFormatProperties](xref:Veldrid.PixelFormatProperties) -- Describes the limits of a Texture's dimensions and other properties if created with the given PixelFormat, TextureType, and TextureUsage flags.
