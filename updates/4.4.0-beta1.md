# Veldrid 4.4.0 Beta 1

*June 25, 2018*

Veldrid version 4.4.0 beta 1 is now available. This is a small update which includes two new features intended provide improved consistency between backends, and increased flexibility with how Shaders are loaded.

## GraphicsDeviceOptions.PreferStandardClipSpaceYDirection

Vulkan clip space is normally inverted compared to other backends. Generally, this can be dealt with by providing a different projection matrix, or by inverting the Y coordinate of the vertex shader's output position. However, Vulkan extensions exist which allow Vulkan to adopt the clip space convention of other API's, with a bottom-to-top increasing clip space. Veldrid now supports this through `GraphicsDeviceOptions.PreferStandardClipSpaceYDirection`. Not all Vulkan devices support this (MoltenVK does not, for example). A device's expected clip space direction can be queried with `GraphicsDevice.IsClipSpaceYInverted`.

## Specialization Constants

SPIR-V and Metal allow certain constant variables defined within shaders to be "specialized" when a Pipeline is created. Veldrid now allows these so-called "Specialization Constants" to be overridden. There are new members which facilitate this:

* `SpecializationConstant[] ShaderSetDescription.Specializations`
* `SpecializationConstant[] ComputeShaderDescription.Specializations`

These options have no effect in the D3D11 and OpenGL backends.

## All Changes

* [Vulkan] Make sure image aspect flags don't include Stencil unless it's a Stencil format image. [[4d60057]](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid/commit/4d600575f98d09a3acf2156e3d1a998aeaf49539)
